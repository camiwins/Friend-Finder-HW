# Friend-Finder-HW
For this assignment we created a survey using everything we've learned so far about full-stack development. We combined our knowledge of creating the front-end of our websites, backend javascript logic and using express servers.

>Note from Cami: This was one of the most difficult assignments I've had so far. Each component individually made sense, however, I ran into several problems trying to connect the backend with the front end. I was only able to complete this assignment because I watched the walkthrough video and relied heavily on it for the 'survey comparison' portion.

# Instructions

2. You'll be taken to another web page for the survey
